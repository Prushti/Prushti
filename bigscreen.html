			<b style="font-size:24px;">Booking Movie Tickets Online is Not Appealing - it takes too much time, you cannot select your seat, and your data may not be safe</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>While many movie ticket booking applications exist, there seems to be a lot desired from the users. Primarily these concerns can be categorized into four categories: </p>
							<p><b>1. More Features: </b>People are unhappy that the existing movie booking apps do not allow them to get more details about the movie or select their seats. This causes them to hesitate leading to them not booking movies as frequently as they would from these applications. </p>
							<p><b>2. No Different Than Buying them at the Theatre: </b>With the existing mobile ticket apps, they cannot select seats, so they have to stand in line at the theatre to get their desired seats even after booking online .</p>
							<p><b>3. Lack of Privacy: </b>Privacy of user data is important especially in today’s age. Existing apps have many privacy issues and there is a lot of skepticism about payments not being secure. </p>
							<p><b>4. Complex On Boarding Process: </b>Most people don’t want to waste time to sign up for these existing apps. They want to skip the sign up process and directly proceed with buying their tickets as it otherwise in fact takes more time than buying them in-person. </p>

                            </p>
							<p>Determined to change the above described scenario, I spent the next 2 months independently investigating this space and designing BigScreen - an iOS mobile app that would allow users to book tickets, read critics/user’s movie reviews, select seats and make payments in a fast and secure fashion. </p>

                            </p>
							<p>I focused on front-loading my generative research in the first stage of my design process. I distributed a survey amongst 35 people and interviewed 6 potential users to gain a deep understanding of their goals and frustrations.</p> <br>

							<div class="wrapper">
								<canvas id="myChart" width="1600" height="900"></canvas>
							</div>
							<script src="js/items/script.js"></script>
							<br>
							<p>Doing this confirmed my observations and made me discover that the audience heavily values user-friendly designs — to the point where they determine whether to keep using an app or not within the first few minutes of the product experience. In addition to this I learned: </p>
							<p>1. <b> 67% </b> of participants still use movie ticket booking applications even though the process is not fast.</p>
							<p>2. <b> 35% </b> use Fandango, the most popular booking app, to book tickets</p>
							<p>3. <b> 25% </b> indicating they use more than one ticket booking application which highlighted the need for an alternative.</p>
							<p>4. <b> 45% </b> of participants wanted features like advance booking, notification and secure seat selection.</p>

							now lowers the barrier to entry for movie ticket booking by allowing you to quickly
							select a movie, see it’s reviews, find a theatre, select your seat, and book your ticket.
							The app’s goal is to be the go-to solution for booking tickets, without you having to ever
							reconsider standing in
							line or using another app again. Below is a look at the final build.

            <p>Slow onboarding was a clear issue in the past. I addressed it by ensuring the
          								signup screen
          								was now just two screens away from home and introduced easy sign-in methods
          								through Facebook and Google.
          								This would now allow users to quickly get into the app and book their tickets.

                select their seat, and use a secure payment method, and book their ticket.

                  get their money back if they do not wish to desire the movie anymore.
