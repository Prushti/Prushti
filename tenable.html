                              As a product designer on Tenable’s 10-person design team, I owned the Scan Management user experience of Tenable’s top three major products IO, SC, and Nessus. This involved cross-functional collaboration with the project manager, developers, copywriter, and QA analyst, to build a robust web enterprise application.

                            <p>
                              To understand our users, we started with a deep dive into the personas and user journey. From there, I designed multiple rounds of wireframes, iterating on feedback from user testing and stakeholders. I led weekly meetings with the stakeholders to walk them through my design decisions and prototypes. Once wireframes were approved, I worked with a copywriter to match the brand voice. Finally, I participated in QA and worked with the developers for the final handoff.

                                          Tenable users faced significant challenges in analyzing scan results for large assets using the older vulnerability management (VM) tool. The tool could have been more convenient, varied, and prone to freezing or breaking due to the overwhelming amount of scan data. This posed a data risk and made it unsuitable for efficient data storage. Moreover, the tool needed more effective tracking mechanisms to prioritize scans and manage assets effectively. The user needed data visualization and a list view with more detailed filter functionality for scan data.

                                                            Once I had a better understanding of the users, the problem, and the proposed solution, I led a user flow session with the team. This helped me understand the different paths the user could take within the tool, which would help me complete the next iteration more effectively.
