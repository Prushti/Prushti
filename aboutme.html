                        <b style="font-size:24px;">Hey there!
I’m Prushti, a code-savvy Product Designer who integrates simple, useful, and delightful experiences into otherwise complex enterprise applications.
</b><br><br>

                          <p>Most recently, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a wide range of e-commerce websites at Distinctly Marketing, a marketing data platform that gives simplified data mining,
						  data modeling and visualization to present clear,easily digestible results in a single view. Distinctly’s home product is unique because it
						  is the only product to provide market research based on demographics and geo location! </p>

                        <br>
                        At Distinctly, I am the sole designer on a small development team designing and developing small to medium
						ecommerce client web applications. Also I am also currently  designing Distinctly‘s own Business Research As a Service (BRaaS) platform which
						will provide data mining and data analytics service to our clients.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Previously, I’ve been a product designer for a number of different small startups including Win-Kel and Scotscro,
						where I collaborated cross-functionally with a design team and developers to improve user experience for an Asian
						market food delivery app,  as well as design a next generation to-do list app to be launched in early 2021.

                        <br><br>
                        With my background in automation testing and analytics, I originally  worked in positions to confirm new
						software was free from “bugs”. After moving to the United States, I had the opportunity to take courses in
						design and realized I could use my analytical skills to help me connect the dots between what the user wants
						and the Market strategy. It was a match made in heaven when I read Everyday UX and could spend hours completing
						design challenges that allowed me to embrace both my love of design and my love of analytics. I'm always excited
						to be looking for my next challenge!


                        <br><br>
						<b><h2>What I do in my free time</b></h2>
						<br>
                        When I’m not designing, I spend my time contemplating design in everyday life. I am also love to meditate,
						learn different healing modalities, and spend time in nature.
						<br><br>
						Feel free to reach out to me any time when you want to discuss the beauty of
						analytical design or just your favorite spot in nature. You can contact
						me at <a href="mailto:prushti.design@gmail.com" target="_blank">Email</a>

                    <p class="bio-text">
                        I'm an impact-driven designer who cares about designing efficient and enjoyable products for
                        users.<br><br>

                          <p>Pursuing a career in UX Design was a natural transition when
                          I realized that UX Design is right at the crossroads of my passions: to analyze how our brain perceives the information, delve into the reasons behind our behavior, approach problem-solving
                           in a creative way and the eagerness to drive change. </p>

                        <br>
                        The trigger was the moment when a designer shared his app idea and asked for my opinion and help to brainstorm how users would interact with the app. The more I inquired about the design process,
                        I discovered that it is something in which I can use my research and analytical skills.

                        <br>
                        I am very grateful for the years I studied Computer Science which help me to grasp new technologies easily. As a Software QA Engineer, my role was to test client/server based
                        web applications which taught me how to identify bugs and test application with different perspectives. It helped me to update
                        my skills constantly and implement strategies to overcome challenges in a highly collaborative environment.

                        <br><br>
                        My goal is to leverage my diverse experiences and UX Design skills to create products that are easy and enjoyable to use.

                        <br><br>
                        In my free time, I love gardening and cooking for my friends, lose track of time discussing ideas and will not miss the opportunity to travel. Have lived and studied in 3 countries, will eagerly learn a new language, I believe it brings people closer and makes any journey memorable.
